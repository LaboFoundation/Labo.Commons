    <description>LightCore is a lightweight dependency injection container which can be used as a service locator, too. Despite its simplicity and its lightness there are lots of features to explore. 

The library was written in C# for .NET 3.5 and above, with an eye on simplicity and clean code (Clean Code Developer). Moreover, LightCore is completely covered by unit and integration tests.</description>
